The app I developed aimed to address user needs for tracking daily weight and setting weight goals. Its core features included adding, updating, and deleting weight entries, setting a goal weight, and sending SMS notifications upon weight updates. The design focused on simplicity, ensuring users could navigate easily, with clear buttons and an intuitive interface. My UI design considered user-centered principles like easy data entry and tracking, which made the app successful for users wanting to monitor their weight progress regularly.

In coding the app, I broke down the project into manageable steps: setting up the database, building the user interface, and then adding functionality like weight entry, updates, and SMS notifications. Testing was an ongoing part of the process, where I tested each component after building it to ensure functionality. This step-by-step testing revealed any issues early and allowed me to address them before moving to the next task.

During the development process, I had to innovate when setting up the SMS notification feature, ensuring that permission requests didnâ€™t disrupt the user experience. I was particularly successful in implementing the database and RecyclerView, which allowed me to display and manage weight entries efficiently. These components demonstrated my understanding of both Android development principles and user-focused design.
